Land mobile radio system (LMRS) is a legacy narrowband technology used for critical voice communications with limited use for data applications.

For example, in the United States, FirstNet is building a nationwide coast-to-coast public safety network based on LTE broadband technology. This paper presents a comparative survey of legacy and the LTE-based public safety networks, and discusses the LMRS-LTE convergence as well as mission-critical push-to-talk over LTE. A simulation study of LMRS and LTE band class 14 technologies is provided using the NS-3 open source tool. An experimental study of APCO-25 and LTE band class 14 is also conducted using software-defined radio to enhance the understanding of the public safety systems.

In general, the construction of intelligent epileptic EEG recognition system involves two steps. First, an appropriate feature extraction method is applied to obtain representative features from the original raw EEG signals. Second, an effective intelligent model is trained based on the extracted features. However, there exist two major challenges in the process: 1) it is nontrivial to determine the appropriate feature extraction method to be used; 2) although many classical machine learning methods have been used for epileptic EEG recognition, most of them are \"black box\" approaches and more interpretable methods are desirable. To address these two challenges, a new epileptic EEG recognition method based on a multiview learning framework and fuzzy system modeling is proposed. First, multiview EEG data are generated by employing different feature extraction methods to obtain the features from different views of the signals. Second, the classical Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is introduced as an easy-to-interpret recognition model to develop a multiview TSK-FS method, called MV-TSK-FS, to identify epileptic EEG signals. For the proposed MV-TSK-FS, the importance of each view, i.e., the importance of each feature extraction method, can be evaluated according to the weighting of each view, and consequently the final decision can be made based on the weighted outputs of different views. Experimental results indicate that the MV-TSK-FS is a promising method when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"[Jiang, Yizhang; Deng, Zhaohong; Wang, Shitong] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Digital Media, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China; [Chung, Fu-Lai] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guanjin; Choi, Kup-Sze] Hong Kong Polytech Un","issn":"1063-6706","issue":1,"volume":25,"language":"English","subjects":"Collaborative learning mechanism , epileptic EEG recognition , multiview learning , Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system , view-weighted mechanism","authorrp":"Jiang, YZ (reprint author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Digital Media, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China."},{"id":4,"sourceid":15,"sourcename":"IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE","title":"Intelligent Interactive Displays in Vehicles with Intent Prediction A Bayesian framework","author":"Intelligent Interactive Displays in Vehicles with Intent Prediction A Bayesian framework","pdf":"/static/pdf/article4.pdf","img":"","summary":"Using an in-vehicle interactive display, such as a touch screen, typically entails undertaking a freehand pointing gesture and dedicating a considerable amount of attention, that can be otherwise available for driving, with potential safety implications.

Regression-based methods currently dominate the approach to solving this problem, which generally employ a series of mapping functions from the face appearance to iteratively update the face shape hypothesis. One keypoint here is thus how to perform the regression procedure. In this work, we formulate this regression procedure as a sparse coding problem. We learn two relational dictionaries, one for the face appearance and the other one for the face shape, with coupled reconstruction coefficient to capture their underlying relationships. To deploy this model for face alignment, we derive the relational dictionaries in a stage-wised manner to perform close-loop refinement of themselves, i.e., the face appearance dictionary is first learned from the face shape dictionary and then used to update the face shape hypothesis, and the updated face shape dictionary from the shape hypothesis is in return used to refine the face appearance dictionary. To improve the model accuracy, we extend this model hierarchically from the whole face shape to face part shapes, thus both the global and local view variations of a face can be captured. To locate facial landmarks under occlusions, we further introduce an occlusion dictionary into the face appearance dictionary to recover face shape from partially occluded face appearance. The occlusion dictionary is learned in a data driven manner from background images to represent a set of elemental occlusion patterns, a sparse combination of which models various practical partial face occlusions. By integrating all these technical innovations, we obtain a robust and accurate approach to locate facial landmarks under different face views and possibly severe occlusions for face images in the wild. Extensive experimental analyses and evaluations on different benchmark datasets, as well as two new datasets built by ourselves, have demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our proposed model, especially for face images with large view variations and/or severe occlusions.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"[Junliang Xing，Zhiheng Niu，Junshi Huang，Weiming Hu ,Xi Zhou，Shuicheng Yan],CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, C","issn":"0098-5589 (ISSNLinking)","issue":0,"volume":0,"language":"English","subjects":"","authorrp":""},{"id":8,"sourceid":16,"sourcename":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE","title":"Nasal Patches and Curves for Expression-Robust 3D Face Recognition","author":"Emambakhsh, Mehryar; Evans, Adrian","pdf":"/static/pdf/article8.pdf","img":"","summary":"The potential of the nasal region for expression robust 3D face recognition is thoroughly investigated by a novel five-step algorithm.

This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images.

Using this equation, we then propose using a polynomial (quadratic) shape prior to resolve the shape ambiguity. Once shape is estimated, we also recover the reflectance.

A classical approach to obtain a single meaningful image partition from a given hierarchy is to cut it in an optimal way, following the seminal approach of the scale-set theory. While interesting in many cases, the resulting segmentation, being a non-horizontal cut, is limited by the structure of the hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that acts by transforming an input hierarchy into a new saliency map. It relies on the notion of shape space: a graph representation of a set of regions extracted from the image. Each region is characterized with an attribute describing it. We weigh the boundaries of a subset of meaningful regions (local minima) in the shape space by extinction values based on the attribute. This extinction-based saliency map represents a new hierarchy of segmentations highlighting regions having some specific characteristics. Each threshold of this map represents a segmentation which is generally different from any cut of the original hierarchy. This new approach thus enlarges the set of possible partition results that can be extracted from a given hierarchy.

By naturally combining two recently rising techniques: active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL), our framework is capable of automatically annotating new instances and incorporating them into training under weak expert recertification. We first initialize the classifier using a few annotated samples for each individual, and extract image features using the convolutional neural nets. Then, a number of candidates are selected from the unannotated samples for classifier updating, in which we apply the current classifiers ranking the samples by the prediction confidence. In particular, our approach utilizes the high-confidence and low-confidence samples in the self-paced and the active user-query way, respectively. The neural nets are later fine-tuned based on the updated classifiers. Such heuristic implementation is formulated as solving a concise active SPL optimization problem, which also advances the SPL development by supplementing a rational dynamic curriculum constraint. The new model finely accords with the \"instructor-student-collaborative\" learning mode in human education. The advantages of this proposed framework are two-folds: i) The required number of annotated samples is significantly decreased while the comparable performance is guaranteed. A dramatic reduction of user effort is also achieved over other state-of-the-art active learning techniques. ii) The mixture of SPL and AL effectively improves not only the classifier accuracy compared to existing AL/SPL methods but also the robustness against noisy data.

Finally, we introduce a few emerging topics.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"[Pelossof, Raphael; Fairchild, Lauren; Widmer, Christian; Sreedharan, Vipin T.; Ratsch, Gunnar; Leslie, Christina S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Fairchild, Lauren] Triinst Training Program ","issn":"0098-5589 (ISSNLinking)","issue":0,"volume":0,"language":"English","subjects":"","authorrp":"Leslie, CS (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.; Fellmann, C (reprint author), Mirimus Inc, Woodbury, NY 11797 USA.; Fellmann, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol \u0026 Cel"},{"id":18,"sourceid":16,"sourcename":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE","title":"Co-Saliency Detection via a Self-Paced Multiple-Instance Learning Framework","author":"Lun, Xiao-Kang; Zanotelli, Vito R.

On one hand, traditional co-saliency detection approaches rely heavily on human knowledge for designing hand-crafted metrics to possibly reflect the faithful properties of the co-salient regions. Such strategies, however, always suffer from poor generalization capability to flexibly adapt various scenarios in real applications. On the other hand, most current methods pursue co-saliency detection in unsupervised fashions. This, however, tends to weaken their performance in real complex scenarios because they are lack of robust learning mechanism to make full use of the weak labels of each image. To alleviate these two problems, this paper proposes a new SP-MIL framework for co-saliency detection, which integrates both multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-paced learning (SPL) into a unified learning framework. Specifically, for the first problem, we formulate the co-saliency detection problem as a MIL paradigm to learn the discriminative classifiers to detect the co-saliency object in the \"instance-level\". The formulated MIL component facilitates our method capable of automatically producing the proper metrics to measure the intra-image contrast and the inter-image consistency for detecting co-saliency in a purely self-learning way. For the second problem, the embedded SPL paradigm is able to alleviate the data ambiguity under the weak supervision of co-saliency detection and guide a robust learning manner in complex scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets together with multiple extended computer vision applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework beyond the state-of-the-arts.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"[Lun, Xiao-Kang; Zanotelli, Vito R.

The essential premise of physical layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers, without relying on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access, interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered. Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical layer message authentication is also briefly introduced.

We review established theories that have analyzed the effect of pilot contamination on the performance of massive MIMO systems, particularly on achievable rates. Next, we categorize the different proposed mitigation techniques for pilot contamination using the following taxonomy: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach.

With the huge increase in both the number of wireless communication subscribers and the bandwidth required per customer, migrating to higher frequencies, i.e., from lower radio frequency to millimeter-wave carriers, is an essential solution. However, due to the short propagation range of millimeter waves, a large number of radio access points are required for providing reliable coverage, which would increase the infrastructure costs. Hence, the transmission of RF signals between the central (or control) points and radio access points (or remote antenna units) using optical fibers is one of the major access network solutions that have been proposed for future high-bandwidth wireless communication systems. In this paper, we introduce the basics of ROF communication, including optical modulation, the optical channel, and the optical detection techniques. Then we survey the family of advanced optical upconversion techniques that exploit the nonlinearity of the ROF link.

Recently, a number of research challenges including the explosive growth in mobile traffic volumes, unprecedented connected devices, and diversified use cases have been identified for the 5G RAN systems. In addition, specific technologies such as multitier communication, massive MIMOs, mmWave backhauling, extreme densifications of nodes (UDNs), full-duplex communications (FDCs), and energy harvesting techniques have emerged in the literature to resolve some of these challenges of the 5G RAN systems. However, the research activities defining specific technical advancements for 5G RAN systems are yet to continue in the next half decade before specifications for standardization and commercialization are concluded. Motivated by the limited number of existing surveys of such technical advancements in a broader perspective (i.e., interference, spectrum-efficient, and energy-efficient management schemes), this paper seeks to take stock of state-of-the-art (SOTA) on such technical developments.

While principal component analysis (PCA) can reduce data size, and scalable solutions exist, it is well-known that outliers can arbitrarily corrupt the results. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches for robust PCA are not scalable. We note that in a zero-mean dataset, each observation spans a one-dimensional subspace, giving a point on the Grassmann manifold. We show that the average subspace corresponds to the leading principal component for Gaussian data. We provide a simple algorithm for computing this Grassmann Average (GA), and show that the subspace estimate is less sensitive to outliers than PCA for general distributions. Because averages can be efficiently computed, we immediately gain scalability. We exploit robust averaging to formulate the Robust Grassmann Average (RGA) as a form of robust PCA. The resulting Trimmed Grassmann Average (TGA) is appropriate for computer vision because it is robust to pixel outliers. The algorithm has linear computational complexity and minimal memory requirements. We demonstrate TGA for background modeling, video restoration, and shadow removal.

Many versions of PCA have been developed for face recognition. However, most of these approaches are sensitive to grossly corrupted entries in a 2D matrix representing a face image. In this paper, we try to reduce the influence of grosses like variations in lighting, facial expressions and occlusions to improve the robustness of PCA. In order to achieve this goal, we present a simple but effective unsupervised preprocessing method, two-dimensional whitening reconstruction (TWR), which includes two stages: 1) A whitening process on a 2D face image matrix rather than a concatenated 1D vector; 2) 2D face image matrix reconstruction. TWR reduces the pixel redundancy of the internal image, meanwhile maintains important intrinsic features. In this way, negative effects introduced by gross-like variations are greatly reduced. Furthermore, the face image with TWR preprocessing could be approximate to a Gaussian signal, on which PCA is more effective. Experiments on benchmark face databases demonstrate that the proposed method could significantly improve the robustness of PCA methods on classification and clustering, especially for the faces with severe illumination changes.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"Florida State University System, University of Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA, Tsinghua University, University Town of Shenzhen, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Peoples R China, Northwestern Polytechnical Univer","issn":"0162-8828","issue":10,"volume":38,"language":"English","subjects":"Two-dimensional whitening reconstruction, preprocessing, PCA, robustness","authorrp":""},{"id":173,"sourceid":16,"sourcename":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE","title":"Principal Curves on Riemannian Manifolds","author":"Hauberg, Soren","pdf":"","img":"","summary":"Euclidean statistics are often generalized to Riemannian manifolds by replacing straight-line interpolations with geodesic ones. While these Riemannian models are familiar-looking, they are restricted by the inflexibility of geodesics, and they rely on constructions which are optimal only in Euclidean domains. We consider extensions of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to Riemannian manifolds. Classic Riemannian approaches seek a geodesic curve passing through the mean that optimizes a criteria of interest. The requirements that the solution both is geodesic and must pass through the mean tend to imply that the methods only work well when the manifold is mostly flat within the support of the generating distribution. We argue that instead of generalizing linear Euclidean models, it is more fruitful to generalize non-linear Euclidean models. Specifically, we extend the classic Principal Curves from Hastie \u0026 Stuetzle to data residing on a complete Riemannian manifold. We show that for elliptical distributions in the tangent of spaces of constant curvature, the standard principal geodesic is a principal curve. The proposed model is simple to compute and avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional geodesic approaches. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the Riemannian principal curves on several manifolds and datasets.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"Technical University of Denmark, Sect Cognit Syst, Lyngby, Denmark, Technical University of Denmark, Sect Cognit Syst, Lyngby, Denmark","issn":"0162-8828","issue":9,"volume":38,"language":"English","subjects":"Principal component analysis, principal curves, differential geometry, Riemannian manifolds","authorrp":""},{"id":174,"sourceid":16,"sourcename":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE","title":"A-Optimal Projection for Image Representation","author":"He, Xiaofei, Zhang, Chiyuan, Zhang, Lijun, Li, Xuelong","pdf":"","img":"","summary":"We consider the problem of image representation from the perspective of statistical design. Recent studies have shown that images are possibly sampled from a low dimensional manifold despite of the fact that the ambient space is usually very high dimensional. Learning low dimensional image representations is crucial for many image processing tasks such as recognition and retrieval. Most of the existing approaches for learning low dimensional representations, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and locality preserving projections (LPP), aim at discovering the geometrical or discriminant structures in the data. In this paper, we take a different perspective from statistical experimental design, and propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm called A-Optimal Projection (AOP). AOP is based on a linear regression model. Specifically, AOP finds the optimal basis functions so that the expected prediction error of the regression model can be minimized if the new representations are used for training the model. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach provides a better representation and achieves higher accuracy in image retrieval.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"Zhejiang University, Coll Comp Sci, State Key Lab CAD \u0026 CG, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China, Zhejiang University, Coll Comp Sci, State Key Lab CAD \u0026 CG, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China, Nanjing University, Natl Key Lab Novel Software","issn":"0162-8828","issue":5,"volume":38,"language":"English","subjects":"Dimensionality reduction, optimal design, image representation","authorrp":""},{"id":175,"sourceid":16,"sourcename":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE","title":"Robust Correlated and Individual Component Analysis","author":"Imperial College London, Dept Comp, London, England, Goldsmiths University London, University of London, Dept Comp, London, England, Imperial College London, Dept Comp, Pattern Recognit Stat Machine Learning Comp Vis, London, England, Imperial College Lon","pdf":"","img":"","summary":"Recovering correlated and individual components of two, possibly temporally misaligned, sets of data is a fundamental task in disciplines such as image, vision, and behavior computing, with application to problems such as multi-modal fusion (via correlated components), predictive analysis, and clustering (via the individual ones).

The inference algorithm is able to utilize distributed computation in order to meet the real-time requirements of autonomous systems in some instances. Because of the probabilistic nature of the model the method is capable of coping with various sources of uncertainty including noise in the visual odometry and inherent ambiguities in the map (e.g., in a Manhattan world).

In general, the construction of intelligent epileptic EEG recognition system involves two steps. First, an appropriate feature extraction method is applied to obtain representative features from the original raw EEG signals. Second, an effective intelligent model is trained based on the extracted features. However, there exist two major challenges in the process: 1) it is nontrivial to determine the appropriate feature extraction method to be used; 2) although many classical machine learning methods have been used for epileptic EEG recognition, most of them are \"black box\" approaches and more interpretable methods are desirable. To address these two challenges, a new epileptic EEG recognition method based on a multiview learning framework and fuzzy system modeling is proposed. First, multiview EEG data are generated by employing different feature extraction methods to obtain the features from different views of the signals. Second, the classical Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is introduced as an easy-to-interpret recognition model to develop a multiview TSK-FS method, called MV-TSK-FS, to identify epileptic EEG signals. For the proposed MV-TSK-FS, the importance of each view, i.e., the importance of each feature extraction method, can be evaluated according to the weighting of each view, and consequently the final decision can be made based on the weighted outputs of different views. Experimental results indicate that the MV-TSK-FS is a promising method when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"Jiang, Yizhang, Deng, Zhaohong, Chung, Fu Lai, Wang, Guanjin, Qian, Pengjiang, Choi, Kup Sze, Wang, Shitong","issn":"1063-6706","issue":1,"volume":25,"language":"English","subjects":"Collaborative learning mechanism, epileptic EEG recognition, multiview learning, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system, view-weighted mechanism","authorrp":""},{"id":178,"sourceid":14,"sourcename":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS","title":"Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Transfer Learning Fuzzy Logic System for the Adaptive Recognition of Epileptic Electroencephalogram Signals","author":"Jiangnan University, Sch Digital Media, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China, Jiangnan University, Sch Digital Media, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Sch Nursing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China, Jiangnan University, Sch Digi","pdf":"","img":"","summary":"The intelligent recognition of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become an important approach to the detection of epilepsy. Among existing intelligent identification methods, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) have shown a distinctive advantage in identifying epileptic EEG signals because of their strong learning abilities and interpretability. Like many conventional intelligent methods for recognizing EEG signals, in the training of FLS, it is assumed that the training dataset and test dataset are drawn from data that are identically distributed. However, this assumption is not necessarily valid in practice as it is not uncommon for the two datasets to have different distributions. To overcome this problem, a strategy is presented in this paper to construct a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) FLS based on transductive transfer learning for identifying epileptic EEG signals. Two novel objective functions, achieved by integrating the transductive transfer learning mechanism, are proposed for the training of the TSK FLS. As regression and binary classification are two common approaches to multiclass classification, the TSK transfer learning FLS algorithms for regression and binary classification are developed, respectively, to construct the corresponding TSK FLS. Both algorithms are further used to perform a multiclass classification to recognize epileptic EEG signals. Their performance in the epileptic EEG datasets indicates promise in dealing with situations where the training and test datasets differ with regard to data distribution.","type":1,"authoraffiliation":"Yang, Changjian, Deng, Zhaohong, Choi, Kup Sze, Wang, Shitong","issn":"1063-6706","issue":5,"volume":24,"language":"English","subjects":"Distribution diversity, electroencephalogram (EEG), epilepsy detection, feature extraction, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy logic system (FLS), transfer learning","authorrp":""}]
